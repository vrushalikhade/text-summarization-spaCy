•	TEXT SUMMARIZATION :

Text summarization refers to the technique of shortening long pieces of text. The intention is to create a coherent and fluent summary having only the main points outlined in the document.
Propelled by the modern technological innovations, data is to this century what oil was to the previous one. Today, our world is parachuted by the gathering and dissemination of huge amounts of data.
With such a big amount of data circulating in the digital space, there is need to develop machine learning algorithms that can automatically shorten longer texts and deliver accurate summaries that can fluently pass the intended messages.
Furthermore, applying text summarization reduces reading time, accelerates the process of researching for information, and increases the amount of information that can fit in an area.
Text summarization is an interesting machine learning field that is increasingly gaining traction. As research in this area continues, we can expect to see breakthroughs that will assist in fluently and accurately shortening long text d

FAST API is a modern, fast , web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
The key features made available by Fast API include High performance, fewer bugs, easy to use and learn, robust, great editor support, etc.
Text Summarization based on Input Type
1. Single Document
This is basically self-explanatory. Single document summarizers aim to summarize one single document.

2. Multiple Document
Multiple Document or multiple text summarization includes multiple documents and the final paper has to contain summarized information from all the documents.

The primary goals of text summarization are-

Optimal topic coverage
Optimal readability

Summarization based on Context:
1. Domain-Specific
Domain knowledge is used in domain-specific summarization.
2. Query Based
Query-based summaries mostly contain information about natural language questions. This is similar to Google’s search results.
3. Generic
Generic summarizations are not programmed to make any assumptions like the domain-specific or query-based summarizers. It just condenses or summarizes the information from the source document.

The Benefits of Using Text Summarization
They make reading easier
It saves time
It helps memorize information easily
It boosts the work rate efficiency

•	Steps to clone and set-up the project :
 Required installtion :
 * vs code 
 * git/git bash
 * github account
•	Steps to clone and set-up the project :

 1) Fork the repository
 
 2) Clone the repository - git clone "repo url"
 
 3) Create & activate virtual environment
    python -m venv fastapienv

    activate venv 
    source fastapi/Scripts/activate
 
 4) Install all dependencies - pip install -r requirements.txt
 
 5) Run through Uvicorn - uvicorn app:app --reload
 
 6) Run the localhost request on your browser - https://localhost:8000
 
 7) Now you will be directed to the Fast API routing methods. Firstly, you need to upload your text file in the POST summary. After successfully uploading your file, you can execute the Get Summary method and acquire the summarized content.
